# rainbow
A simple image database and client, optimized to store and render small original pixel images (sprites). The client gets original sized images (1:1 pixel ratio) and scales and displays them sharp at any size (no antialiasing). Built with Meteor.js.

Rainbow is a rewrite of eboydb. Image files are not stored in the database anymore. Instead, the files can be located anywhere and are referenced as URLs.
